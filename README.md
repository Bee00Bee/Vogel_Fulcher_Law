### Vogel Fulcher Law
The Vogel Fulcher Law has been used widely in Physics specifically in magnetism. The numerical ways to find the fit parameters are the challenge since the local minimum requires a lot of effort. One way is to linearize the data. You can find more information about this law here:

The two files in this repository are used to find the fit parameters from numerical computations. 

These Matlab files are useful to find two linear fits in a dataset.
